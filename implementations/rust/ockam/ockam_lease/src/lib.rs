//! Lease - metadata for securely managing secrets
//!
//! This crate provides the ability to manage leases
//!
//! A lease is metadata about a secret that indicates a validity period,
//! renewability, and tags. The use case is wrapping a token to an external service
//! which doesnâ€™t support such features. Leases will wrap the token such that the
//! token is guaranteed to be valid while the lease is valid.
//! A lease is revoked at the end of the time duration.
//! Some may support renewals such as extending the validity period.
//! A lease can be revoked at any time by the issuing party.
//!
//! The main Ockam crate re-exports types defined in this crate.
